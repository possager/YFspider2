 'content': u'\n\t\t\t\t Tibetan Entrepreneurship Development (TED), an initiative of the Department of Finance, today organised an introductory program for the first student Entrepreneurial Club in Upper TCV School. The function was graced by Finance Kalon, Mr. Tsering Dhundup, who was the keynote speaker, Upper TCV Principal Mr. Namdol Tashi and Senior School Head Mistress Ms. Ngawang Lhamo. TED Executive program officer Mr. Tenzin Khenrab and TED student program Officer Mr. Tenzin Norsang were also present. The program was attended by 408 students of class 11 and 12 including the senior staff and teachers of the school. \n The TED student entrepreneurship program aims to educate the Tibetan students about entrepreneurship by supporting the various Tibetan school administrations in inculcating the CBSE entrepreneurship elective into the school curriculum and also introduce an extra-curricular activity such as Entrepreneurial club in the schools. TED will be formulating the model for the entrepreneurial club in collaboration with the particular schools and also in consultations with the University of Maryland, Washington. \n Finance Kalon, Mr. Tsering Dhundup gave a brief talk on the vision and aim of the TED student entrepreneurship program and also a highly inspirational talk to the students about entrepreneurship. He also motivated the students by talking about the potential and the positive impact an entrepreneur can have on the development of the Tibetan community on the whole and also provide an opportunity for economic self-sustenance of the Tibetan diaspora. \n TED Student coordinator, Mr. Tenzin Norsang gave a presentation on the TED student program and an introduction into entrepreneurship citing live examples from the entrepreneurship world. During the presentation, he specifically stressed on the point that \u201ccreativity and innovation\u201d is the way forward to achieve entrepreneurship success. \n TED is a recently conceptualised initiative of the Department of Finance, Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) aiming to mobilise and amplify Tibetan entrepreneurial spirit by fostering, nurturing, accelerating value-add connections and celebrating entrepreneurship. TED aims to affect the profound transformation of the Tibetan community in-exile with its role as a mobiliser of the Tibetan entrepreneurial spirit to partake in global opportunities and contribute to the community\u2019s economic well-being. In doing so, TED aims to support existing businesses\u2019 expansion and sustainability, as well as convert high-potential youth business ideas into successful ventures. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t',

 'content': u'\n\t\t\t\t The first-ever Tibetan Entrepreneur\u2019s Game Changers Conference, organised by Tibetan Entrepreneurship Development (TED), an initiative of the Department of Finance is currently underway at Nyatri Hall, Gangchen Kyishong. \n Over a hundred Tibetan entrepreneurs and budding businessmen including web designers, fast food makers, organic product traders, mobile app designers, etc. are participating in the two-day conference. \n Sikyong Dr. Lobsang Sangay accompanied by fellow m embers of the 14th Kashag inaugurated the conference this morning. \n In his inaugural address, Sikyong Dr. Lobsang Sangay underlined the importance of the role played by entrepreneurs in the economic development of a community. He added that in the Tibetan context, entrepreneurship is even imperative due to the political status of the Tibetan people as refugees, which makes survival even more demanding. \n At the same time, Sikyong appreciated the fact that Tibetans are hard working and more enterprising as compared to their neighbors in the Tibetan settlements, as proven by a data collected by a private researcher recently. The data revealed that in a typical Tibetan family, both the father and the mother go for work, which results in double income sources as compared to others, where the father is the sole breadwinner. \n Sikyong also called for more such conferences and workshops in future to expand the Tibetan entrepreneurial network and effectively amplify the Tibetan entrepreneurial spirit by fostering, nurturing and enriching entrepreneurial knowledge. \n Finance Kalon Mr. Tsering Dhundup, in his address, said that entrepreneurship is key to sustaining the economic viability of a country. He talked about the growth of Tibetan economy since 1959 under the visionary guidance of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the efforts of the Tibetan cooperative societies. \n The two-day GameChangers conference, in line with the objectives of TED, is aimed at creating an annual platform for collaboration, innovation and networking between Tibetan Entrepreneurs and the world. It enables Tibetan entrepreneurs to build networks, enrich knowledge, and connect mentors and investors to pitch their business ideas on the given platform. \n The conference was initiated after analyzing the current needs of the nascent Tibetan entrepreneurship ecosystem to ensure a profound transformation from the current business culture within the Tibetan community towards a system at par with mainstream entrepreneurs at national and global level. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t',

The panel of Judges are all experts in various fields of entrepreneurship and the jury provided valuable advice and suggestions for the future of the business and also set the milestones, according to which the seed funding will be released.

In the short period of 5 weeks, we learnt so much and we were able to develop our concrete business plan. Personally, I can now confidently say we are ready to take our business to the next level in the coming times and I am sure the other TED entrepreneurs feel the same way too. \u201c \n TED is a recently conceptualised initiative of the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) aiming to mobilise and amplify Tibetan entrepreneurship spirit by fostering, nurturing, accelerating value-add connections, and celebrating entrepreneurship. TED aims to affect the profound transformation of the Tibetan community in exile with its role as a mobiliser of the Tibetan entrepreneurial spirit to partake in global opportunities and contribute to the community\u2019s economic well-being.

 'content': u'\n\t\t\t\t [31 January 2017]  For the second consecutive year, Tibet has ranked as the second worst place in the world for freedom and human rights, according to a report published by Freedom House. Countries with appalling human rights records such as North Korea and Eritrea ranked better than Tibet; only Syria was considered worse out of the 210 countries and territories assessed. \r\r \r\n \r\n On 31 January 2017, US-based NGO Freedom House published its annual report,  Freedom in the World 2017 , assessing the state of global freedom over the past 12 months. \r\n \r\nAs in last year\'s report,  Tibet was ranked as the second worst country/territory for overall freedom, with only Syria ranked worse.  Tibet received maximum ratings for the lack of political rights, civil liberties and freedom. Other countries considered "worst of the worst" by Freedom House, but below Tibet, include Eritrea, North Korea, Turkmenistan, South Sudan and Somalia. \r\n \r\nFreedom House did not report in detail on Tibet, but in its  country profile of China  stated,  "The [Chinese] government continued to impose conditions approaching martial law in Tibetan- and Uighur-populated regions of the country, refusing to reassess failed policies of repression for these ethnic minority groups." \r\n \r\n China was ranked 24th out of the  195 countries and 15 territories  that were scored.  Both China and Tibet were given the status of "Not Free". \r\n \r\nChina was also marked as being on a "downward trend" with respect to freedoms and liberties. Freedom House stated this was due to, "the chilling effect generated by cybersecurity and foreign NGO laws, increased internet surveillance, and lengthy prison sentences for human rights lawyers, activists, and religious believers." \r\n \r\nFreedom House noted that  one of the key developments in China in 2016 was the aim of the Chinese government to "tighten control" over religion . The report specified, "A plan for \u201ccomprehensive management\u201d of all religious activity and organizations and the \u201cSinicization\u201d of religion in China, laid out at an April party conference, further restricted the scope for religious freedoms."  \r\n \r\nThe report also highlighted the Chinese promotion of nationalism, with an increasingly hostile anti-Western tone, the use of defending national security to "justify criminal prosecutions of civil society and democracy activists, human rights lawyers and bloggers" and increased internet surveillance resulting in the imprisonment of those promoting "politically sensitive" issues online. \r\n \r\nFreedom House heeded a warning over the general trend towards nationalism led by authoritarian rulers who ignore international commitments and focus primarily on protecting their own interests. "History shows that this strategy leads to ruin. When universal values and international law are cast aside, global affairs are governed by force." \r\n \r\n Further reading:   Freedom House report  |  country scores  |  China profile \r\n \r\n Previous reports: \r\n 2016:   Tibet second only to Syria for lack of freedom   (Tibet Society) \r\n 2015:   Tibet ranked \u2018Worst of the Worst\u2019 for political and civil rights   (Tibet Society) \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nTibet Society, the world\u2019s first Tibet support group, was  founded in 1959. Funded by its members, it has been working for over 50  years to seek justice for Tibet through parliamentary lobbying,  campaigns and actions. Help keep Tibet alive by joining Tibet Society  today.

The nine-minute film follows Tashi as he travels to Beijing in an attempt to file a lawsuit against local officials over the lack of Tibetan language education in schools. \r\n \r\n In November 2015, Tashi was the feature of an online  New York Times  short documentary, \u201cA Tibetan\u2019s Journey for Justice\u201d  (see video below ). The nine-minute film follows Tashi as he travels to Beijing in an attempt to file a lawsuit against local officials over the lack of Tibetan language education in schools. \r\n \r\nIn an interview, also published in the  New York Times , Tashi said,  \u201cMy goal is to change things a little bit, to push to preserve some of our nation\u2019s culture. The entire Tibetan ethnic nationality and culture is at risk of disappearing.\u201d  He also said he was thankful to \u201call the Chinese people who truly protect minorities\u201d. \r\n \r\n On 27 January 2016, Tashi was detained by Chinese police in Jyekundo (Chinese: Yushu), in the eastern  Tibetan region of Kham (now part of China\'s Qinghai province).  \r\n \r\nTashi was held in secret for weeks at the main detention centre in Jyekundo. His relatives only learned of his detention on 24 March. The family were given an official document, dated 4 March, which stated Tashi was being charged with "inciting separatism". They were only allowed to visit him in September 2016. \r\n \r\nTashi has only been allowed to see a lawyer twice, in June and September 2016. \r\n \r\nIn early January 2017, Tashi was indicted after his case was resubmitted to the courts. This followed a request last year by Chinese prosecutors for more time to investigate the case.  \r\n \r\nThough critical of the threats to Tibetan language and culture, Tashi has never written about Tibetan independence. His language campaign is in line with China\'s Constitution, of which Article 4 states, "Ethnic minorities\' right to learn, use and develop their own spoken and written languages is guaranteed in accordance with the law\u201d. \r\n \r\nIt is feared Tashi will not receive due process, as many Tibetans facing \'political\' charges are denied legal representation of their own choosing, that he will be subject to torture and ill-treatment whilst in detention, and faces a sentence of up to 15 years imprisonment if found guilty. \r\n \r\nAmidst China\u2019s current crackdown, Tashi Wangchuk\'s case is an example of how Tibetans face additional persecution for any activity perceived as a threat to Chinese rule, through charges of "separatism". \r\n \r\nTashi Wangchuk could face up to 15 years in prison and is at risk of torture. In China, defendants are almost always found guilty once a case is brought to court. The conviction rate in 2015 was 99.92% according to official statistics. \r\n \r\n Further reading: \r\n 10 Mar 2016:  Tibetan Entrepreneur Has Been Illegally Detained, Family Says   (NY Times) \r\n31 Mar 2016:  China Charges Tibetan Education Advocate With Inciting Separatism  (NY Times) \r\n28 Dec 2016:  Chinese Prosecutors Ask Court for More Time in Detained Tibetan\u2019s Case   (NY Times) \r\n15 Jan 2017:  China - Drop Charges Against Tibetan Education Activist   (Human Rights Watch) \r\n18 Jan 2017:  Tibetan education advocate indicted: Tashi Wangchuk   (Amnesty International) \r\n18 Jan 2017:  Tibetan language advocate indicted, trial imminent   (Tibet Society) \r\n 27 Jan 2017:  Tashi Wangchuk\'s detention epitomises China\'s brutal regime   (Tibet Society)  \r\n \r\n New York Times  articles qouting Tashi Wangchuk: \r\n Tibetans Fight to Salvage Fading Culture in China  (28 Nov 2015) \r\n A Showcase of Tibetan Culture Serves Chinese Political Goals  (19 Dec 2015) \r\n \r\n \r\n New York Times documentary (9 mins) \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nTibet Society, the world\u2019s first Tibet support group, was  founded in 1959.

The nine-minute film follows Tashi as he travels to Beijing in an attempt to file a lawsuit against local officials over the lack of Tibetan language education in schools. \r\n \r\n In November 2015, Tashi was the feature of an online  New York Times  short documentary, \u201cA Tibetan\u2019s Journey for Justice\u201d  (see video below ). The nine-minute film follows Tashi as he travels to Beijing in an attempt to file a lawsuit against local officials over the lack of Tibetan language education in schools. \r\n \r\nIn an interview, also published in the  New York Times , Tashi said,  \u201cMy goal is to change things a little bit, to push to preserve some of our nation\u2019s culture. The entire Tibetan ethnic nationality and culture is at risk of disappearing.\u201d  He also said he was thankful to \u201call the Chinese people who truly protect minorities\u201d. \r\n \r\n On 27 January 2016, Tashi was detained by Chinese police in Jyekundo (Chinese: Yushu), in the eastern  Tibetan region of Kham (now part of China\'s Qinghai province).  \r\n \r\nTashi was held in secret for weeks at the main detention centre in Jyekundo. His relatives only learned of his detention on 24 March. The family were given an official document, dated 4 March, which stated Tashi was being charged with "inciting separatism". They were only allowed to visit him in September 2016. \r\n \r\nTashi has only been allowed to see a lawyer twice, in June and September 2016. \r\n \r\nIn early January 2017, Tashi was indicted after his case was resubmitted to the courts. This followed a request last year by Chinese prosecutors for more time to investigate the case.  \r\n \r\nThough critical of the threats to Tibetan language and culture, Tashi has never written about Tibetan independence. His language campaign is in line with China\'s Constitution, of which Article 4 states, "Ethnic minorities\' right to learn, use and develop their own spoken and written languages is guaranteed in accordance with the law\u201d. \r\n \r\nIt is feared Tashi will not receive due process, as many Tibetans facing \'political\' charges are denied legal representation of their own choosing, that he will be subject to torture and ill-treatment whilst in detention, and faces a sentence of up to 15 years imprisonment if found guilty. \r\n \r\nAmidst China\u2019s current crackdown, Tashi Wangchuk\'s case is an example of how Tibetans face additional persecution for any activity perceived as a threat to Chinese rule, through charges of "separatism". \r\n \r\nTashi Wangchuk could face up to 15 years in prison and is at risk of torture. In China, defendants are almost always found guilty once a case is brought to court. The conviction rate in 2015 was 99.92% according to official statistics. \r\n \r\n Further reading: \r\n 10 Mar 2016:  Tibetan Entrepreneur Has Been Illegally Detained, Family Says   (NY Times) \r\n31 Mar 2016:  China Charges Tibetan Education Advocate With Inciting Separatism  (NY Times) \r\n28 Dec 2016:  Chinese Prosecutors Ask Court for More Time in Detained Tibetan\u2019s Case   (NY Times) \r\n15 Jan 2017:  China - Drop Charges Against Tibetan Education Activist   (Human Rights Watch) \r\n18 Jan 2017:  Tibetan education advocate indicted: Tashi Wangchuk   (Amnesty International) \r\n18 Jan 2017:  Tibetan language advocate indicted, trial imminent   (Tibet Society) \r\n 27 Jan 2017:  Tashi Wangchuk\'s detention epitomises China\'s brutal regime   (Tibet Society)  \r\n \r\n New York Times  articles qouting Tashi Wangchuk: \r\n Tibetans Fight to Salvage Fading Culture in China  (28 Nov 2015) \r\n A Showcase of Tibetan Culture Serves Chinese Political Goals  (19 Dec 2015) \r\n \r\n \r\n New York Times documentary (9 mins) \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nTibet Society, the world\u2019s first Tibet support group, was  founded in 1959.

Thousands of Tibetan students have already been expelled and many of their dwellings demolished. China aims to reduce the population by half, to 5,000, by September 2017, possibly even earlier. \r\n \r\nAs well as the destruction of dwellings and expulsion of residents, the authorities are increasing surveillance, implementing entry screening procedures and forming new management committees to be led by a majority of government officials. \r\n \r\nAnother Buddhist Institute in Sichuan, Yachen Gar is also facing a severe crackdown. 1,000 nuns are reported to have been expelled and told they are not allowed to join any other religious institutions. \r\n \r\nAll of this interference in Tibetan Buddhist affairs is counter to China\'s own Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, both of which guarantee religious freedom for all. \r\n \r\nPlease ask the Foreign Secretary to raise this as a matter of urgency with his Chinese counterparts. Also, please call on the Foreign Secretary to make a public statement calling for an immediate halt to the demolition work at Larung Gar, an end to the expulsions at both Larung Gar and Yachen Gar, for all those expelled to be allowed to return, for the residents of the institutes to be allowed to run their own affairs without government interference, and for all Tibetans to be allowed to freely practice their religion. \r\n \r\nYours sincerely \r\n\xa0 \r\n Please send copies of any replies you receive to Tibet Society - email  \n  \n <!--\n var prefix = \'&#109;a\' + \'i&#108;\' + \'&#116;o\';\n var path = \'hr\' + \'ef\' + \'=\';\n var addy47570 = \'&#105;nf&#111;\' + \'&#64;\';\n addy47570 = addy47570 + \'t&#105;b&#101;ts&#111;c&#105;&#101;ty\' + \'&#46;\' + \'c&#111;m\';\n document.write( \'<a \' + path + \'\\\'\' + prefix + \':\' + addy47570 + \'\\\'>\' );\n document.write( addy47570 );\n document.write( \'<\\/a>\' );\n //-->\\n  \n <!--\n document.write( \'<span style=\\\'display: none;\\\'>\' );\n //-->\n  This e-mail address is being protected from spam bots, you need JavaScript enabled to view it\n  \n <!--\n document.write( \'</\' );\n document.write( \'span>\' );\n //-->\n   or post to Tibet Society, 2 Baltic Place, London N1 5AQ - as this helps us to monitor the government\'s actions. \r\n \r\n \r\n 3.

The demolition of dwellings began on 20 July 2016. However, in Janaury 2017, Chinese authorities called for demolitions and evictions to be completed by March 2017. \r\n \r\nThe population reduction is part of a strategy by the Chinese authorities to place the Institute under government control and ensure it conforms to Party policy. The strategy includes increased surveillance, "ideological guidance" and the creation of management committees led by government officials. \r\n \r\nLarung Gar is located in Serthar county, Kardze prefecture, in the traditional Tibetan province of Kham (now incorporated into China\u2019s Sichuan province). \r\n \r\nExpulsions are also taking place at  Yachen Gar , another large monastic institution in Sichuan province. 1,000 nuns have been forced to return to their homes and told they cannot join any other religious institutions. \r\n \r\n Read more: \r\n China expelling half the population of influential Tibetan Buddhist institute \r\n (Tibet Society, 10 August 2016)   \r\n Three nuns commit suicide at Larung Gar in protest against demolition \r\n (Tibet Society, 6 September 2016) \r\n Larung Gar nuns told to voluntarily leave or face religious ban \r\n (Tibet Society, 11 October 2016) \r\n Demolitions and evictions recommence at Larung Gar \r\n (Tibet Society, 17 February 2017) \r\n \r\n \r\nGlobal Day of Action: 19 October 2016 \r\n \r\n On Wednesday 19 October 2016, Tibet groups around the world held a day of action in support of the Larung Gar Buddhist Institute. \r\n \r\nIn London, there was a peaceful demonstration outside the Chinese  Embassy, organised jointly by Tibet Society, Free Tibet, Students for a  Free Tibet UK and Tibetan Community in Britain.

 'content': u'\n\t\t\t\t [17 February 2017]  Following a short winter break, Chinese authorities have recommenced demolitions and forced evictions at the Larung Gar Buddhist Institute in eastern Tibet. Those evicted have been forced to sign pledges never to return and are subject to political re-education classes. In addition, local authorities have introduced new restrictions for those wishing to study at the Institute. \r\r \r\n \r\n Demolition of Larung Gar recommences \r\n The destruction of Larung Gar stopped temporarily at the beginning of January due to the onset of winter conditions  (picture right, from RFA taken in December) . Initially, it was expected the work teams would return in April in order to complete the demolitions and evictions by September, as set out in the original government order. However, according to Radio Free Asia, Chinese officials have decided to expedite the work and have set a new completion date of 30 March. Demolitions were expected to recommence on 10 February. \r\n \r\nDemolition work and forced evictions at Larung Gar began on 20 July 2016, following a government order to reduce the resident population to 5,000 persons by September 2017. Officially, the population of Larung Gar was said to be 10,000, however unofficial estimates believe the population to be considerably higher. \r\n \r\nIt is unclear exactly how many monks and nuns have been forced to leave so far as the Chinese authorities have not provided any official information. In mid-December, a Radio Free Asia source estimated 9,000 people had already been forcibly expelled from Larung Gar. \r\n \r\n Evictees forced to pledge never to return \r\n Evicted monks and nuns are being forced to sign documents vowing to never return to Larung Gar. According to Radio Free Asia, the documents also contain pledges to \u201cuphold the unity of the nation\u201d and not to engage in behaviour opposing government policy in the area. \r\n \r\nMany of those evicted are also subject to political re-education classes upon their return home. Such classes usually involve pledging allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party and denouncing the Dalai Lama. \r\n \r\n New entry restrictions introduced \r\nChinese officials have introduced new restrictions on those wishing to study at Larung Gar. Students must now complete a political exam and obtain approval from the local authorities. \r\n \r\nAccording to Radio Free Asia, individuals "wanting to study Tibetan Buddhism [at Larung Gar] must now pass a "political examination" administered by the police." If passed, a permit can then be applied for from the Serthar county government. However, it is believed only monks and nuns from the local area will be considered for entry. \r\n \r\n Further reading:  Radio Free Asia -  23 Jan  |  9 Dec  |  4 Nov  |  31 Oct \r\nTibet Post -  4 Nov \r\n \r\n Previous Tibet Society reports on Larung Gar \r\n China expelling half the population  (10 Aug 2016) \r\n Three nuns commit suicide  (6 Sept 2016) \r\n Nuns told to leave or face ban  (11 Oct 2016) \r\n \r\n CLICK\xa0HERE\xa0TO\xa0TAKE ACTION \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nTibet Society, the world\u2019s first Tibet support group, was  founded in 1959.

A letter was delivered to 10 Downing Street, followed by a procession from Downing Street to Trafalgar Square, where a vigil was held. \r\r \r\n Members of Tibetan Uyghur and Chinese Solidarity UK, of which Tibet Society is a founding member, delivered a  letter to Theresa May  at 10 Downing Street on the morning of Saturday 10 December. The letter asked the UK Government to speak out on China\'s human rights abuses. It highlighted the endemic use of torture in China, and the cases of three political prisoners: Chinese blogger Zhang Haitao, Uyghur academic Ilham Tohti and Tibetan language advocate Tashi Wangchuk. \r\n \r\nApproximately 60 people gathered for the vigil, despite the dreary, wet weather. The vigil was themed as a "Solidarity Vigil Against Torture in China". Following the delivery of the letter, a peaceful procession was held along Whitehall to Trafalgar Square.  \r\n \r\n The procession was led with a banner saying "Freedom, Human Rights, Democracy" in four languages: Tibetan, Chinese, Uyghur and English. Participants also carried messages calling for the release of the three prisoners and an end to torture in China, Tibet and East Turkestan. \r\n \r\nAt Trafalgar Square speeches were delivered from representatives of each community about each of the three prisoners of conscience being highlighted. Kunsang Dolma from Tibetan Community UK spoke on the injustice of Tashi Wangchuk\'s imprisonment and the situation of Tibetans losing their identity in Tibet. \r\n \r\n During the procession and vigil,  leaflets  were distributed to passers-by to give further background to the solidarity vigil and provide information the three chosen political prisoners. \r\n \r\n \xa0Further reading: \r\n Letter to Prime Minister Theresa May \r\n Download leaflets handed out at vigil  (PDF) \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nTibet Society, the world\u2019s first Tibet support group, was  founded in 1959.

 'content': u'\n\t\t\t\t Dear Members and Friends of Tibet, \r\n \r\nURGENT APPEAL: CAN YOU PLEASE HELP TO SAVE THE TIBET SOCIETY? \r\n \r\nMy name is Tsering Passang and I have an urgent and important request to make to you on behalf of the Tibet Society.  \r\n \r\n \r\n \xa0 \r\r Since the 1959 Chinese invasion of Tibet, and the subsequent illegal occupation, the Tibet Society has played a pivotal role in keeping the flame of Tibetan independence alive. It has also kept the spotlight shining on the cruel and shocking human rights abuses and the pillaging of Tibet\u2019s natural resources. But with an ageing and declining membership the Tibet Society is in a perilous financial position.  Without your help I am afraid it faces a critical point in the next 6 to 9 months. Yes, I am sad to have to report the situation is that serious. \r\n \r\nHowever, a generous donation from you today, and from other friends of Tibet, will help the Society to continue its vital advocacy work beyond the 9-month critical period. \r\n \r\n Forgive me but I would like to tell you my story and what the Tibet Society means to me and to all of the Tibetan community. \r\n \r\n I was born in a refugee camp in western Nepal. Everyone in the camp, and refugee settlements across India, highly value the important work of the Tibet Society. It gives us hope in our hearts as well as vital practical help. \r\n \r\n Recently I returned to the refugee camp in Nepal and the Tibetans I met there were deeply saddened by the difficult financial position of the Tibet Society. They like me know the great work it has done and, importantly can go on to do, if only it has the resources it so badly needs. \r\n \r\n \u201cAll hope can sometimes seem gone but with friends like the Tibet Society we can feel renewed in our freedom struggle. I am so old now I won\u2019t see Tibet again but I pray others in exile will. All we want is to have our country back so we can live in peace once again.\u201d\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 - A message from Tenzin Khedup, 80 year-old Tibetan refugee living in Nepal \r\n So, at this very critical time for the Tibet Society can I ask you please to donate generously through online (PayPal account) or by writing a cheque made payable to \u2018Tibet Society\u2019 and post it to: Tibet Society, 2 Baltic Place, London N1 5AQ. \r\n \r\n Thank you. Thuk-je-che! \r\n \r\n \r\nTsering Passang \r\n Special Adviser \r\n Tibet Society \r\n \r\n PS:  A generous donation from you today, and from other friends of Tibet, will help the Society to continue its vital advocacy work beyond the 9-month critical period. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\xa0 \t\t\t',

 'content': u'\n\t\t\t\t [28 November 2016]  Over the past month, two UK-China Dialogues have taken place in London, one on human rights and the other on trade and economics. Unfortunately, the UK placed considerably more significance on the Economic Dialogue, as signified by the presence of the Prime Minister, whilst the Human Rights Dialogue was left to a newly-appointed junior minister. \r\r \r\nPrime Minister Theresa May and Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond were part of the UK-China Economic Dialogue held in London on 10-11 November. Meanwhile, the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue, held on 27-28 October, was led by Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Foreign Office Alok Sharma. \r\n \r\n UK-China Economic Dialogue \r\n \r\n The 8th UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue was held in London on 10-11 November. Prime Minister Theresa May opened the meeting, with the two delegations led by Chancellor Philip Hammond and Chinese Vice-Premier Ma Kai respectively  (pictured right) . The meeting was also attended by a number of other senior officials from both countries. \r\n \r\n Following the row over Chinese investment in the Hinkley Point nuclear power station, Theresa May attempted to allay any outstanding Chinese concerns by reiterating her predecessor\'s claim of an upturn in relations between the UK and China. May said, \u201cAs we take the next step in this golden era of relations between the UK and China, I am excited about the opportunities for expanding trade and investment between our two countries.\u201d \r\n \r\nAs well as publicity for the continued \'special relationship\' between the UK and China, the economic dialogue was expected to secure \xa35 billion worth of Chinese investment in infrastructure and property schemes across the north of England, as well as progressing on other trade deals pitched by the previous Chancellor George Osborne. \r\n \r\n UK-China Human Rights Dialogue \r\n \r\n The 23rd UK-China Human Rights Dialogue took place in London on 27-28 October. The UK delegation was led by Foreign Office Minister Alok Sharma, with Special Representative for Human Rights Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Liu Hua heading the Chinese delegation. \r\n \r\nIn contrast to the Economic Dialogue, there was little in the way of official announcements on the outcome of the Human Rights Dialogue. Only a short statement by Alok Sharma has been issued which gave little away. \r\n \r\nIn the statement, published on the government\'s website, Alok Sharma, said, "Senior officials discussed the full range of matters relating to human rights, including on freedom of expression and religion." He added, "The dialogue was held in a constructive and open manner." Other than the UK calling for the release of Chinese human rights lawyers and activists following the crackdown in China which began in July 2015, no other specific information about what was raised has been officially released. Nor has there been any detail of any response from the Chinese delegation or any outcomes from the meeting. \r\n \r\nHowever, Tibet Society has since been informed by Foreign Office sources that the UK delegation raised the following issues: Larung Gar; the Panchen Lama plus a number of other Tibetan political prisoners; and, diplomatic access to Tibet (there has been no UK diplomatic visit to Tibet since 2009). \r\n \r\n Tibet Society continues to call on the UK government to publicise its key concerns raised in the Human Rights Dialogue, to make the Dialogue more open and transparent, including the involvement of civil society, and to initiate a process involving benchmarks to ascertain whether progress is being made on human rights in Tibet and China. \r\n \r\n Further reading: \r\n Tibet Society briefs Foreign Office prior to UK-China Human Rights Dialogue  \r\n28 Oct:  Alok Sharma comments on UK-China Human Rights Dialogue  (Gov.uk) \r\n10 Nov:  Theresa May promises \'golden era\' in UK-Chinese relations  (BBC) \r\n10 Nov:  UK-China relations still \'golden\', says PM  (Guardian) \r\n \r\n \r\nTibet Society, the world\u2019s first Tibet support group, was  founded in 1959.

Tashi, a Tibetan language advocate, was arrested a year ago after  The New York Times  featured his work. \r\r \r\n Click here  to TAKE\xa0ACTION \r\n \r\n \r\n According to a report published on 18 January by Amnesty International,  Tashi Wangchuk has now been indicted by the prosecutor and faces a trial which could begin at any time.  Tashi\'s case was resubmitted to the Yushu Intermediate People\u2019s Court by the Procuratorate in early January following a further investigation into his case.  \r\n \r\nTashi Wangchuk, an advocate of Tibetan language education, was initially detained by Chinese police on 27 January 2016 and  charged with \u201cinciting separatism\u201d .  \r\n \r\nIn December,  The New York Times  reported that Chinese prosecutors had asked for more time to investigate the case. One of Tashi\'s two lawyers, Lin Qilei, said such a request was "very rare". His other lawyer, Liang Xiaojun, confirmed that the case related to Tashi\'s interview with  The New York Times  about his language advocacy work. \r\n \r\nHuman Rights Watch reported that the re-investigation into Tashi\'s case was completed on 4 January 2017. \r\n \r\n Tashi Wangchuk could face up to 15 years in prison and is at risk of torture.  In China, defendants are almost always found guilty once a case is brought to court. The conviction rate in 2015 was 99.92% according to Chinese official statistics. \r\n \r\nTashi was arrested in Jyekundo (Chinese: Yushu), in the eastern Tibetan region of Kham (now part of China\'s Qinghai province), after  The New York Times  produced a video documentary and published feature articles on his efforts to file a lawsuit against local officials over the lack of Tibetan language education in schools in the Yushu area. \r\n \r\n Note:  Tibet Society has raised the case with the UK Foreign Office and asked for the British Embassy in Beijing to make representations on behalf of Tashi. \r\n \r\n Further reading:   Amnesty International  |  Human Rights Watch  |  New York Times \r\n \r\n TAKE\xa0ACTION:  Click here  to help Tashi by signing the online petition and writing to the Chinese authorities. \r\n \r\n \r\nTibet Society, the world\u2019s first Tibet support group, was  founded in 1959.

 'content': u'\n\t\t\t\t [18 November 2016]  Prior to the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue held at the end of October, Tibet Society submitted a report on Tibetan political prisoners to the Foreign Office and briefed the new Minister for Asia and the Pacific on human rights issues in Tibet. It is understood many of these issues were raised during the dialogue, though disappointingly no official statement has been made to confirm this. \r\r \r\n \r\nBriefing at the Foreign Office \r\n \r\nTibet Society was one of a number of human rights NGOs invited to brief new minister Alok Sharma in mid-October prior to the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue. Alok Sharma is the Minister responsible for Asia and the Pacific and led the UK delegation at the Dialogue. Mr Sharma replaced Hugo Swire in the reshuffle following David Cameron\'s resignation in July. \r\n \r\n At the briefing with Mr Sharma and senior Foreign Office civil servants, Tibet Society and other Tibet group representatives raised a number of issues of concern: religious repression including the current crisis at Larung Gar; political prisoner cases including  Tashi Wangchuk  and  Shokjang ; the 20-year disappearance of Tibet\'s  Panchen Lama , Gedhun Choekyi Nyima; and, the UK government\'s policy on Tibet and the use of language such as "not supporting Tibetan independence". \r\n \r\n (Pictured above: Outside the Foreign Office - Paul Golding, Tibet Society; Kunsang Dolma, Tibetan Community UK, Eleanor Byrne-Rosengren, Free Tibet; and, Ellen Lees, Students for a Free Tibet UK) \r\n \r\n Thanks to Tibet supporters writing to their MPs and the Foreign Office, the minister and civil servants were already well aware of the Larung Gar issue and many of the political prisoner cases  and stated they were planning to raise the issues with their Chinese counterparts during the Dialogue. \r\n \r\nAt the end of the briefing Tibet Society presented the Foreign Office with a copy of its report  "Imprisoned in Tibet" . The report details the cases of four Tibetans who have died in custody since the last UK-China Human Rights Dialogue (held in April 2015). The report also highlights the cases of 12 Tibetan political prisoners who have been sentenced since April 2015 and the case of Tashi Wangchuk who is currently awaiting trial. \r\n \r\n Download the report: Imprisoned in Tibet \r\n (PDF\xa0document, 12 pages) \r\n \r\n \r\nUK-China Human Rights Dialogue \r\n \r\nThe 23rd UK-China Human Rights Dialogue took place in London on 27-28 October 2016. The UK delegation was led by Foreign Office Minister Alok Sharma, with Special Representative for Human Rights Affairs of the Foreign Ministry Liu Hua heading the Chinese delegation. \r\n \r\nUnfortunately, to date, little information has been forthcoming about the proceedings and China\'s responses to the cases and issues raised by the UK. \r\n \r\nFollowing the Dialogue, Alok Sharma  issued a statement  saying, "Senior officials discussed the full range of matters relating to human rights, including on freedom of expression and religion." He added, "The dialogue was held in a constructive and open manner." The statement made no reference to Tibet or any of the outcomes of the dialogue. \r\n \r\nHowever, Tibet Society has since been informed by Foreign Office sources that the UK delegation raised the following issues: Larung Gar; the Panchen Lama plus a number of other Tibetan political prisoners; and, diplomatic access to Tibet (there has been no UK diplomatic visit to Tibet since 2009). \r\n \r\n Tibet Society continues to call on the UK government to publicise its key concerns raised in the Dialogue, to make the Dialogue more open and transparent, including the involvement of civil society and to initiate a process involving benchmarks to ascertain whether progress is being made on human rights in Tibet and China. \r\n \r\n Download the report: Imprisoned in Tibet \r\n (PDF\xa0document, 12 pages) \r\n \r\n \r\nTibet Society, the world\u2019s first Tibet support group, was  founded in 1959. Funded by its members, it has been working for over 50  years to seek justice for Tibet through parliamentary lobbying,  campaigns and actions. Help keep Tibet alive by joining Tibet Society  today.

The exiled Tibetan political leader also called for \u201ca coordinated approach\u201d between the UK, US and EU to tackle China over Tibet. The Sikyong also met with the Speaker of the House of Commons, a meeting which was condemned by China. The parliamentary visit was part of the Sikyong's five-day visit to the UK. \r\r \r\n Sikyong at UK Parliament  |  Meeting with Speaker  |  China's response  | \r\n UK trip  |    Opinion in  The Guardian  |  Biography \r\n \r\n \r\n The Sikyong at UK Parliament \r\n \r\n On 1 November 2016, Sikyong Dr Lobsang Sangay, gave a briefing and held a discussion with MPs at the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, London. The meeting was hosted by the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Tibet (APPGT) and chaired by Tim Loughton MP (Chair of the APPGT).  [The Sikyong is the democratically-elected political leader of the Tibetan people, and heads the Central Tibetan Administration based in Dharamsala, northern India. He is effectively the Prime Minister.] \r\n \r\nDuring the meeting, Dr Sangay covered a range of topics, including the lack of religious freedom in Tibet, the exploitation of Tibet's natural resources and China's development of the region. He specifically discussed the demolitions at Larung Gar Buddhist Institute and the suicide of three nuns due to the forced evictions. \r\n \r\n Dr Sangay stated China\u2019s political and religious repression of the Tibetan people continues to this day. He said the Chinese government's goal is to sinocise Tibet, by targeting the foundations of Tibetan civilisation: Tibetan Buddhism, Tibetan culture and Tibetan language.  \r\n \r\n The Sikyong emphasised the Dalai Lama\u2019s and Central Tibetan Administration\u2019s commitment to the Middle Way Approach, which seeks genuine autonomy for Tibet.  Dr Sangay referenced President Obama\u2019s support for the Middle Way, saying he \u201c[hoped] the UK Government will come out with a similar statement\u201d. He also asked MPs to speak out in solidarity with those at Larung Gar and express support for the Middle Way Approach. \r\n \r\n Dr Sangay stressed his belief that the UK needs to co-ordinate with the US and EU in order to properly address the Tibet issue with China. He stated that British support was \u201calways noted in Beijing\u201d as well as giving hope to Tibetans in Tibet.  \r\n \r\nTim Loughton MP thanked the Sikyong for his briefing and said the UK should be seen to be \u201cstanding shoulder-to-shoulder\u201d with other countries in solidarity with Tibet. \r\n \r\nDuring the following discussion MPs raised a number of questions, including the state of negotiations with China, China\u2019s exploitation of Tibet's water resources, the relationship between the exiled community and the Indian government, and the future of the Dalai Lama lineage. \r\n \r\n MPs attending included Nic Dakin, Fabian Hamilton, Chris Law, Tim Loughton, Dr Tania Mathias, Kerry McCarthy, Liz McInnes, Patrick Grady and Catherine West. \r\n \r\n See more photos via  facebook \r\n \r\n \r\n Sikyong meets Speaker of the House \r\n \r\n Following his meeting with the APPG for Tibet, the Sikyong met Rt Hon John Bercow MP, the Speaker of the House of Commons. In the private meeting, the two discussed current issues affecting Tibet and the Speaker recounted his previous meetings with the Dalai Lama. According to the Central Tibetan Administration,  the Speaker \u201cexpressed his strong support for the non-violent and just cause of Tibet\u201d . \r\n \r\nAfter the private meeting, the Sikyong went to the House of Commons public gallery to watch proceedings. In an unprecedented gesture, the Speaker, from the Speaker\u2019s chair, acknowledged the Sikyong\u2019s presence in the gallery, saying it was \u201ca pleasure and a privilege\u201d to welcome him to the House.  (See video clip below.) \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n China condemns Sikyong and Speaker meeting \r\n \r\nChina criticised the UK government for allowing the Sikyong to meet the Speaker of the House, calling Dr Sangay a \u201cseparatist\u201d and the leader of an illegitimate government. \r\n \r\nAt a press conference on 4 November, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said, \u201cChina is opposed to this act by the Speaker of UK House of Commons which  imperils China\u2019s core interests . The so called Tibetan government in exile was formed by fleeing separatists after a failed coup in 1959 and has no legitimacy or international recognition. China strongly opposes Lobsang Sangay and other people\u2019s separatist acts in any capacity in any country and will strongly oppose their contact with foreign officials.\u201d \r\n \r\nThe spokesperson added, \u201cWe urge the UK to honour their promise and avoid causing damage to China-UK relations.\u201d \r\n \r\n (Source:  Press Trust India ) \r\n \r\n \r\n Sikyong in the UK: 30 Oct - 3 Nov \r\n \r\nThe Sikyong arrived in the UK on 30 October for a five-day visit. On his first day, Dr Sangay gave a talk at the University of London Union to members of the Tibetan community living in Britain. He also he met with young Tibetan children at the London School of Tibetan Language and Culture and spoke about the importance of learning and preserving one\u2019s language and cultural identity. \r\n \r\nOn 31 October, the Sikyong had an Opinion published in  The Guardian , entitled:  \u201cA plea to Britain: don\u2019t forget Tibet in your dealings with China\u201d .  (Read more below.) \r\n \r\nDuring his second day in the UK, Dr Sangay gave a talk to students at Westminster University on the uniqueness of Tibetan experimentation with democracy in exile. Later in the day, the Sikyong travelled to Oxford and gave a talk entitled \u2018Rise of China, what about Tibet?\u2019 at the prestigious Oxford Union, where the likes of Winston Churchill, Ronald Reagan, Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama have spoken. \r\n \r\n On 1 November, following his visit to Parliament, the Sikyong gave an interview on  BBC World News  television. During his interview with Haida Yakim, Dr Sangay called on world leaders to put in practice their values on democracy and human rights and not shy away from meeting the Dalai Lama. \r\n \r\nThe Sikyong also discussed China\u2019s ultimate goal for Tibet, which he said was \u201cto turn Tibet into China; make Tibetans into Chinese, that\u2019s their cultural assimilation drive.\u201d However, he added that Tibetans will persevere, noting, \u201cTibetan identity is deeply rooted... Tibetan people will be there on the Tibetan plateau for [a] long time to come.\u201d  (Read full transcript.) \r\n \r\nThe Sikyong had further engagements with dignitaries and officials whilst in the UK, including a meeting with representatives of UK-based Tibet support groups including Tibet Society. The Sikyong departed the UK on 3 November. \r\n \r\n \r\nThe Sikyong writes in  The Guardian \r\n \r\n On 31 October,  The Guardian  published an Opinion by the Sikyong. In his article, Dr Sangay called on the UK government to  \u201cre-evaluate its engagement\u201d  with China and take a leading role with other like-minded governments  \u201cto act together from a position of strength to confront the Chinese leadership\u201d . \r\n \r\nDr Sangay said the UK should promote  \u201can approach that balances its business, trade and diplomatic interests with a respect for the rights of the Chinese and Tibetan people.\u201d   \r\n \r\nHe added,  \u201c[The UK] must hold fast to its commitment to upholding the democratic values that shape the spirit of this great country,\u201d  but warned,  \u201cFailing to do so only endorses China\u2019s efforts to impose its narrative on the rest of the world.\u201d \r\n \r\nRead the full article via  The Guardian : \r\n A plea to Britain: don't forget Tibet in your dealings with China \r\n \r\n \r\n Biography of Dr Lobsang Sangay \r\n \r\n Dr. Lobsang Sangay was born and grew up in a Tibetan settlement near Darjeeling, northern India, where he attended the Central School for Tibetans.

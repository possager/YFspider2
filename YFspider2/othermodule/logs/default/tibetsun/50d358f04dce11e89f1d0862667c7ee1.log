 'content': u'Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has congratulated the two Koreas for agreeing to end the Korean War and beginning a new era of peace on the Korean peninsula. The Dalai Lama has written separately to both the North Korean and South Korean leaders to congratulate them on the pledge they made following recent talks to work to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons and turn the armistice that ended the Korean War into a peace treaty this year. \u201cAs an avowed campaigner for demilitarization throughout the world and the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons, I wholeheartedly welcome the outcome of your discussions to secure lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.\u201d He has written that the immense suffering caused by war and violence in so many different parts of the world is deeply distressing. \u201cWhat you have shown is that taking a genuinely peaceful approach and entering into dialogue is the only way to achieve friendship, trust, and peace.\u201d Moon Jae-in, President of South Korea, and Kim Jong-un, Supreme Leader of North Korea, held the 2018 inter-Korean summit that took place on 27 April on the South Korean side of the border-straddling village of Panmunjom. It was the first time since the end of the Korean War in 1953 that a North Korean leader entered the South\u2019s territory. President Moon also briefly crossed into the North\u2019s territory. The summit was focused on the North Korean nuclear weapons programme and denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. The Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity, and Unification of the Korean Peninsula was adopted following the summit. According to the declaration, the leaders of North and South Korea agreed to work together on ending the Korean War, beginning a new era of peace and sharing commitments in ending divisions and confrontation by approaching a new era of national reconciliation, peace, and prosperity, and improvements to inter-Korean relations. The declaration implies removing nuclear weapons from both Koreas.',

 'content': u'North Korea leader Kim Jong-un and South Korea President Moon Jae-in held a historic summit Friday after shaking hands over the Military Demarcation Line that divides their countries, in a gesture laden with symbolism. Kim said he was \u201cfilled with emotion\u201d after stepping over the concrete blocks, making him the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean War ended in an armistice 65 years ago. At Kim\u2019s impromptu invitation the two men briefly crossed hand-in-hand into the North before walking to the Peace House building on the southern side of the truce village of Panmunjom for the summit \u2014 only the third of its kind since hostilities ceased in 1953. \u201cI came here determined to send a starting signal at the threshold of a new history,\u201d said Kim, whose nuclear-armed regime is accused of widespread human rights abuses. With the North\u2019s atomic arsenal high on the agenda, Moon responded that he hoped they would reach \u201ca bold agreement so that we may give a big gift to the whole Korean people and the people who want peace\u201d. Kim was flanked by his sister and close adviser Kim Yo Jong and the North\u2019s head of inter-Korean relations, while Moon was accompanied by his spy chief and chief of staff. It is the highest-level encounter yet in a whirlwind of nuclear diplomacy, and intended to pave the way for a much-anticipated encounter between Kim and US President Donald Trump. The North\u2019s official KCNA news agency said that Kim will \u201copen-heartedly discuss \u2026 all the issues arising in improving inter-Korean relations and achieving peace, prosperity and reunification of the Korean peninsula\u201d. But it did not mention denuclearisation, and as images of the leaders\u2019 handshake were beamed around the world, the North\u2019s state television showed only a test card. Last year Pyongyang carried out its sixth nuclear blast, by far its most powerful to date, and launched missiles capable of reaching the US mainland. Its actions sent tensions soaring as Kim and Trump traded personal insults and threats of war. Moon seized on the South\u2019s Winter Olympics as an opportunity to broker dialogue between them, and has said his meeting with Kim will serve to set up the summit between Pyongyang and Washington. The White House said in a statement that it hoped the summit would \u201cachieve progress toward a future of peace and prosperity for the entire Korean Peninsula\u201d. Trump has demanded the North give up its weapons, and Washington is pressing for it to do so in a complete, verifiable and irreversible way. But Seoul played down expectations Thursday, saying the North\u2019s technological advances with its nuclear and missile programmes meant any deal would be \u201cfundamentally different in nature from denuclearisation agreements in 1990s and early 2000s\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this summit all the more difficult,\u201d the chief of the South\u2019s presidential secretariat Im Jong-seok told reporters. Pyongyang is demanding as-yet-unspecified security guarantees to discuss its arsenal. When Kim visited the North\u2019s key backer Beijing last month in only his first foreign trip as leader, China\u2019s state media cited him saying that the issue could be resolved, as long as Seoul and Washington take \u201cprogressive and synchronous measures for the realisation of peace\u201d. In the past, North Korean support for denuclearisation of the \u201cKorean peninsula\u201d has been code for the removal of US troops from the South and the end of its nuclear umbrella over its security ally \u2014 prospects unthinkable in Washington. Moon said he hoped they would have further meetings on both sides of the peninsula, and Kim offered to visit Seoul \u201cany time\u201d he was invited. But Robert Kelly of Pusan National University warned that Pyongyang \u201chasn\u2019t really changed, and it hasn\u2019t offered a meaningful concession yet\u201d, adding there were still \u201chuge\u201d strategic and political divisions between the North on one hand, and the South and the US on the other. Yonsei University professor John Delury said the post-summit statement will give \u201ca lot of chance to analyse every word, reading between the lines, look for things that are there and not there\u201d. Pyongyang announced last week a moratorium on nuclear tests and intercontinental ballistic missiles, adding it would dismantle its Punggye-ri nuclear test site. But it also said it had completed the development of its weapons and had no need for further tests. Seoul has also promoted the idea of opening talks towards a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, when hostilities stopped with a ceasefire, leaving the neighbours technically in a state of conflict. Reunions of families left divided by the war could also be discussed at the summit, and Moon has told Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe he will raise the emotive subject of Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North. After a morning session lasting an hour and 40 minutes, Kim crossed back to the North for lunch, a dozen security guards jogging alongside his limousine. Before the afternoon session, Moon and Kim are to hold a symbolic tree planting ceremony on the demarcation line. The soil will come from Mount Paektu, on the North\u2019s border with China, and Mount Halla, on the South\u2019s southern island of Jeju. After they sign an agreement a joint statement will be issued, with a banquet and farewell ceremony to follow in the evening before Kim returns to the North.',
